# Deep-Optimal-Stopping for Bermudan Max-Call Options
This project implements the deep optimal stopping framework to price Bermudan max-call options. Using neural networks trained on Monte Carlo simulations under the Black–Scholes model, the code approximates optimal stopping rules and computes lower and upper bounds for option values in high-dimensional settings, following Becker, Cheridito, and Jentzen (2019).
